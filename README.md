# Isosceles_Triangle
Read x and y integer coordinates of three points of a triangle and print them. Find out the lengths of the three sides of the triangle and print them. Test whether they form an isosceles triangle. If no, print that triangle is not an isosceles triangle and end. If it is an isosceles triangle, then print the lengths of base and height and also print the area of the triangle.
